Date of interview: Watched video on April 27th 2020
interviewer: jimmy and cj
customer name: Yasuho
company name: 

Background: 
Yasuho is a Japanese 22 year old who works as a delivery person
Yasuho does not have any experience with Chronote, but we hope that a person like her would benefit from using the
app to assist in accomplishing time-sensitive tasks throughout the day


I would categorize Yasuho's potential use cases for Chronote on weekdays in two main categories: home and work use

User can choose to have subroutines to break up the morning into chunks of either location (bathroom vs bedroom vs 
breakfast table/kitchen), type of routine, etc

We noticed that after this user gets to work, the timeblock tend to be bigger because you're doing the same task
for a while

It is apparent that the Yasuho is expected to arrive at work around 7:00 in the morning. Since she wakes up at 5:45,
that is only 1 hour and 15 minutes to include waking up getting ready and commute time


Problem:
Yasuho definitely will have to glance at the time at least once while getting ready for work.
Takeaway:
Why not just have pleasant sounding alarms every few minutes to remind you of what time it is?

Problem:
Yasuho does wear a watch, but in the event that she wants to check her phone to know the time, every time you
unlock your phone is a chance to be distracted by your phone then go down a rabbit hole
Takeaway:
Just play a sound that you memorize what time it means then you won't be distracted
